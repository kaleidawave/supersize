# Supersize

Hyperfine inspired CLI tool for tracking file sizes

Measures file sizes:
- Compressions:
  - Uncompressed
  - Gzip
  - Brotli
- Total size of folders
- Pattern based matches
  - `--include` to only show sizes for files which match glob
  - `--exclude` to ignore sizes for files which match glob

# TODO

- Help command
- Detailed breakdown for files
- Error handling
